        <h2>I am a web developer and web designer. How do I get new customers?</h2>
        <p>Originally Answered: I am a web developer and web designer, how do I get new customers? I find this very very hard though my clients love my work and have recommended me
          Believe me, people are looking for good web dev/design people. Here's some thoughts:</p>
          
         <p>01. Make sure you have a really solid understanding of your strengths and weaknesses. Are you more creative or better at HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP...? Are you a good project manager or do you work better on a team that has someone responsible for project management? Nobody is good at everything. It is OK to have weaknesses as long as you are aware of them.</p>
        <p>02.Make your website (you do have one, don't you?) look great. Make sure it's responsive. Put Google Analytics on it and review it from time to time to see what people are or aren't looking at. Assuming you're a one person company don't go over the top, just be sure to have good design, and...</p>
         <p>03. Show off your portfolio on your website. Heavily load it with more recent designs, if people click through some older, non-responsive designs they may move on before getting to your good stuff. Be sure each portfolio item has it's own separate URL that you can send people to (see #7).</p>
         <p>04.Show off customer testimonials on your home page. Have a photo of your client (if they agree) next to a quote.</p>
          
        <p>05.  Be clear about where your strengths are. Design is right brain, development is left brain. (Although maybe not accurate, it is still a useful descriptive model.) Very few people are strong at both. Maybe you are, but to me it throws up a red flag when someone says they are good at both. When I meet a dev and/or design person that I think I may want to work with I make them prioritize their strengths so I can create the right team.</p>
        <p>06. If project management is not a strength align yourself with agencies that have dedicated project managers. (See #9 for more agency ideas.)</p>
         <p>07. Define your target customers/industries. Don't always send links to your entire portfolio to prospects, send a link or two to a specific project you've done for a client that is similar to your prospect. You want to talk about past clients that make prospective clients think "that company is just like me" or "they had the same problem I have".</p>
         <p>08. Help a prospective client figure out how their website will fit in their overall marketing strategy. If it needs to generate new leads find the company then SEO is critical, and the client needs to think about content and outbound marketing. If the client gets their customers by referral, then a more basic brochure site that helps someone learn more about the company might be all they need. Understand your clients needs and propose and deliver that. Don't oversell, make what they need.</p>
         <p>09. Many creative agencies don't have development people on the team, and many digital agencies don't have design resources. Almost all agencies need to outsource from time to time. I hear "do you know a good web dev person?" a lot. Network and talk to as many agencies as you can.</p>
         <p>10. There are a lot of freelance designers that work with small companies that are really good at doing branding work, printed brochures, but aren't so good at website implementation. Look for these people and partner with them. They may call themselves an agency, not a designer.!</p>
